# Comprehensive Implementation Plan (React Native + MediaMTX + React Native Firebase)

Below is an updated step-by-step plan that specifically uses **React Native Firebase** instead of the generic Firebase JS SDK. It covers project structure, frontend, backend, data models, and API definitions, mixing React Native Firebase with a Node-based backend, **MediaMTX** for streaming, and **FFmpeg** for transcoding.

---

## 1. Project Initialization & Structure

1. **Create a Monorepo or Multi-Folder Setup**  
   - One folder for the React Native frontend.  
   - One folder for your Node backend (including Firebase Functions or a separate server).  
   - A Docker setup or server config to host MediaMTX and run FFmpeg.

2. **Install Global Dependencies**  
   - Node, plus Yarn or npm (for React Native and backend).  
   - FFmpeg (for video processing).  
   - Docker (if you plan to containerize MediaMTX).

3. **Initialize React Native**  
   - Use your preferred CLI command (e.g., `npx react-native init TikTokClone`).

4. **Initialize Backend**  
   - Create a new folder for the backend with a package manager (NPM/Yarn).

5. **Add MediaMTX**  
   - Either install or run it via Docker.  
   - Configure your docker-compose setup with ports for RTMP, RTSP, and HTTP streaming protocols.

6. **Add MINIO **  
   - Either install or run it via Docker.  
   - Configure your docker-compose setup with ports for storage.

## 2. Firebase Setup (React Native Firebase)

1. **Create a Firebase Project**  
   - Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.  
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore or Realtime Database.  
   - (Optional) Add Cloud Functions if needed for serverless tasks.

2. **Install React Native Firebase Libraries**  
   - In the React Native app folder, install the React Native Firebase packages for your desired features (e.g. auth, firestore).

3. **Initialize React Native Firebase**  
   - Configure your app with the required native build changes (following React Native Firebase documentation).  
   - Create a setup file for React Native Firebase that initializes Auth, Firestore.

## 3. Frontend Steps (React Native)

1. **Screens & Navigation**  
   - Home (feed of videos).  
   - Profile (user info, own videos).  
   - Post/Upload flow (capturing or selecting video).  
   - Authentication (sign in/up).

2. **Video Capture/Upload Flow**  
   - Use a React Native library (e.g., a camera package) to record or select a video.  
   - Upload to MediaMTX if streaming, or store to MINIO if saving a clip.  


3. **Player Component**  
   - On-demand playback: fetch video URLs from MINIO.  
   - Live playback: fetch HLS or WebRTC streams from MediaMTX.


4. **Feed Rendering**  
   - Retrieve video metadata from Firestore.  
   - Display videos in a scrollable list, with optional autoplay for the current item.

---

## 4. Backend Steps (Node + Firebase Integration)

1. **Option A: Use Firebase Functions**  
   - Set up triggers for Auth, Firestore, or Cloud Storage.  
   - Implement post-processing tasks (e.g., thumbnail generation) using FFmpeg in a Cloud Function.

2. **Option B: Use a Custom Node Server**  
   - Set up a standard Express server.  
   - Integrate Firebase Admin SDK for secure writes/reads to Firestore.  
   - Invoke FFmpeg for transcoding and thumbnail generation as needed.

---

## 5. Data Models

- **Users**: Stores user info (ID, email, username, bio, followers, creation date).  
- **Videos**: Stores metadata (ID, user reference, title, description, video URL, likes, comments count, timestamp).  
- **Comments**: Stores comment text, user reference, and associated video ID.

---

## 6. API Endpoints

If using a custom Node backend:

- **User**  
  - Create user, log in, fetch user info.  
- **Video**  
  - Save metadata, retrieve or list videos, update likes, etc.  
- **Comments**  
  - Add comments, fetch comments for a video.

If strictly using Firebase Functions, you'd create similar endpoints via HTTP triggers or rely on direct Firestore interactions from the client.

---

## 7. FFmpeg Integration & MediaMTX

1. **MediaMTX**  
   - Receives live RTMP streams from your React Native app if going live.  
   - Distributes them via HLS or WebRTC for viewing in near-real-time.

2. **FFmpeg**  
   - Used for on-demand transcoding or thumbnail generation.  
   - Typically invoked after file upload to MiniIO Storage (through a Cloud Function or backend worker).

---

## 8. Testing

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Use Jest or React Native Testing Library for UI components.  
   - Test backend routes with Mocha/Jest if using a Node server.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Validate that video uploads hit MINIIO Storage and metadata appears in Firestore.  
   - Confirm live streaming works via MediaMTX.

3. **Device Testing**  
   - Try on real iOS/Android devices and simulators/emulators.  
   - Specifically test performance for continuous playback and live streaming.

---

## 9. Deployment

1. **Backend**  
   - Deploy Node server to AWS, Heroku, or any platform of choice.  
   - Alternatively, rely on Firebase Functions if mostly serverless.  
   - Containerize MediaMTX if needed and run behind a load balancer.

2. **Frontend (React Native)**  
   - Build and publish to the Apple App Store and Google Play.

3. **Monitor in Firebase**  
   - Check Firebase console for analytics, usage, and logs.  
   - Adjust scaling or rules as traffic grows.
